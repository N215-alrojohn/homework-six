## adding tour pages
The assignment for this week was to continue working on the Travel Fly project. Now there are pages for all of the avaliable tour packages as well as functional navigation between those pages AND them all being responsive to 800px. I made sure the tours page was accessible from the home and about pages that we have so far, and that there was backwards navigation ability. From there each of the buttons on the page leads to a new page that is styled with one SCSS file. I used inline styling to change the images on every page, since the basic formatting of the pages was the exact same besides for the images. Then I used media queries to make them all responsive in the same way for continuity.
